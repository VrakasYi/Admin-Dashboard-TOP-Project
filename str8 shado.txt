To achieve an inset shadow on the left side of a container that remains straight and doesn't curve along with the rounded edges, you can use a combination of an inner wrapper element and the `box-shadow` property. The inner wrapper will create the straight shadow, and the outer container will have rounded corners. Here's how you can do it:

HTML:
```html
<div class="outer-container">
  <div class="inner-wrapper">
    <!-- Your content goes here -->
  </div>
</div>
```

CSS:
```css
.outer-container {
  width: 200px;
  height: 150px;
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  border-radius: 15px; /* Set the desired border radius */
  overflow: hidden; /* Ensure the inner shadow doesn't overflow */
}

.inner-wrapper {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: transparent; /* Set the background to transparent */
  box-shadow: inset -10px 0 10px -10px #888888; /* The key is to use a negative spread radius */
}
```

In this example, we use an `.outer-container` to have rounded corners, and an `.inner-wrapper` is added inside it. The `.inner-wrapper` has a negative spread radius, which offsets the shadow outside the box, effectively creating a straight shadow on the left side.

By adjusting the `box-shadow` values, you can control the position, size, and color of the shadow.

Feel free to adjust the dimensions, border radius, and shadow properties to match your specific design requirements.
